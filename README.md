#Swiss

This is Swiss bracket calculator. It's still not 100% functional yet, and I should have implement a Player class instead of having some ridiculous parallel arrays.
Oh well, that'll work in version 2!

This is also going to be a browser app, because Web programming is just so much better.

Features:

* Supports any size bracket
* Fully automated bracket
* Can split into Top 4/8/16/etc, will make a recommendation when you should
* Runs in any browser
* Allows editing at any point of the tournament
